  { id:1,  category:'network-fundamentals', difficulty:'easy',   question:'At which OSI layer does a router operate?',                                          options:['Layer 1 (Physical)','Layer 2 (Data Link)','Layer 3 (Network)','Layer 4 (Transport)'],                                                   correctAnswer:2, explanation:'Routers operate at Layer 3 (Network). They forward packets based on destination IP and maintain routing tables.' },
  { id:2,  category:'network-fundamentals', difficulty:'medium', question:'How many usable host addresses are in a /26 subnet?',                              options:['30','62','126','254'],                                                                                                                          correctAnswer:1, explanation:'A /26 has 6 host bits → 2⁶ = 64 addresses. Minus network + broadcast = 62 usable hosts.' },
  { id:3,  category:'network-fundamentals', difficulty:'easy',   question:'Which protocol uses UDP port 69?',                                                 options:['FTP','TFTP','HTTP','Telnet'],                                                                                                                    correctAnswer:1, explanation:'TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) uses UDP port 69 for config and IOS image transfers.' },

  { id:5,  category:'switching',            difficulty:'hard',   question:'Which command restricts a trunk to VLANs 10, 20 and 30?',                        options:['switchport trunk vlan 10,20,30','switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30','switchport trunk permit vlan 10,20,30','vlan trunk allowed 10,20,30'], correctAnswer:1, explanation:'"switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30" explicitly permits only those VLANs on the trunk.' },
  { id:6,  category:'routing',              difficulty:'medium', question:'What is the administrative distance of OSPF?',                                     options:['90','100','110','120'],                                                                                                                         correctAnswer:2, explanation:'OSPF = 110. Lower AD is more trusted: Connected 0, Static 1, EIGRP 90, OSPF 110, RIP 120.' },
  { id:7,  category:'routing',              difficulty:'hard',   question:'What must be true for an EIGRP route to be a feasible successor?',               options:['Reported Distance < Feasible Distance','Feasible Distance < Reported Distance','Metric equals successor metric','AD lower than OSPF'],           correctAnswer:0, explanation:'Feasibility condition: RD < FD. This guarantees the route is loop-free and can serve as a backup path.' },
  { id:8,  category:'switching',            difficulty:'medium', question:'What is the default native VLAN on Cisco switches?',                             options:['VLAN 0','VLAN 1','VLAN 10','VLAN 1005'],                                                                                                        correctAnswer:1, explanation:'VLAN 1 is the default native VLAN. Best practice: change it to an unused VLAN to prevent hopping attacks.' },
  { id:9,  category:'security',             difficulty:'medium', question:'What happens in port security "restrict" violation mode?',                       options:['Port shuts down, needs manual fix','Packets dropped + violation logged','All traffic allowed but logged','Port security disabled'],           correctAnswer:1, explanation:'Restrict drops bad packets, logs violations, and sends SNMP traps — but keeps the port up.' },
  { id:10, category:'security',             difficulty:'hard',   question:'Which feature depends on DHCP snooping being enabled?',                         options:['Port Security','Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)','PortFast','BPDU Guard'],                                                                      correctAnswer:1, explanation:'DAI uses the DHCP snooping binding table to validate ARP packets and stop ARP spoofing.' },
  { id:11, category:'wireless',             difficulty:'medium', question:'Which 802.11 standard is 5 GHz-only and reaches 6.9 Gbps?',                    options:['802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)','802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)','802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)','802.11g'],                                                                      correctAnswer:1, explanation:'802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) operates only at 5 GHz and supports up to 6.9 Gbps via MU-MIMO.' },
  { id:12, category:'automation',           difficulty:'medium', question:'Which HTTP method retrieves data without modifying it?',                        options:['POST','PUT','GET','DELETE'],                                                                                                                     correctAnswer:2, explanation:'GET is read-only and idempotent — repeating the request yields the same result.' },
